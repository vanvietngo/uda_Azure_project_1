Cost
The App Service will have lower cost than VM, when testing you also can select the Free services first so it will lower cost for development and also production to deploy the CMS app.

Scalability
Both of VM and App Service have good choice for scalability. 

Availability
Both of VM and App Service have high availability.

Workflow
If we have simple app, the App Service is the best choice. VM which have more complex steps before your apps online

Solution/Choice for current CMS App
The best option for this CMS App is App Service, since the code or the app no need specific functional that need to be customized. Mostly we do simple CRUD so no need high processing.
